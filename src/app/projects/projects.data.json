    "concept_description": "The hotel holding company requested a new Hotel Gabriel website with an intergrated custom booking platform that will give the user the possibility to have a complete booking flow entirely on the hotel's website, without being redirected on the main booking engines.\n\n The project was divided in two main parts: first of all the client requested a WordPress installation as base structure of the hotel's website, the second part consisted in the creation of a suite of web components that allows the user to complete the booking flow.",
    "description": "This set of built-in components are reusable for every hotel of the Holding company and the first project was Hotel Gabriel Paris. The main goal was to share the components in more frontend contexts.\n\nThey can be imported in any project without dependencies, in any framework or library, they simply need a basic configuration. Components are made to be customizable and flexible, and they support the multilanguage. In Hotel Gabriel we made them speak with the new Wordpress custom theme we created.\n.",
    "description_1": "These components use REST API services made by a partner company, that provide all the necessary booking data.\nWeb components are made using the WEB COMPONENTS technology, that today is supported in all modern browsers.\n\nTo render the components we used Stenciljs, from Ionic team, that provides some polyfills for the legacy browsers such as IE11, to reach a better compatibility.",
    "description_2": "Here are listed the components present in our project:\n\nroom list with relative prices,\n\nroom detail with all details and prices for different rates,\n\nroom rate with detail of prices and sell conditions,\n\ncalendar picker with booking dates,\n\nselector for the number of the guests,\n\nsummary of what the user has in cart,\n\nlist of possible extra to include in the reservation,\n\ncustomer detail form at the end of the booking flow.",

Based on these findings it has been evolved the idea that anything can change with effort, perseverance and motivation just making the first step to our goal.",
    "description": "From this concept it started the #onestepcloser campaign of Nike, inviting people to be perseverant and improve their lives like Rio did with simple lifestyle goals to accomplish during olympic games such as: use less the phone, use less the car or visit frequently a specific place. To do this Nike launches a worldwide app that lets users set their goals and track their progresses. This app will be the core of a huge campaign that wants to give the impression that Nike owns the world during Olympic Games’ period.",
    "description_1": "This impression is achieved by using a lot of communication touchpoints around cities that will introduce the concept and bring users to download the app. The first event that opens tha campaign and launches the app is a big marathon worldwide, a race against oneself that will be also the closing event of the campaign wich will reward those who beat their first race-time. After the marathon there will be active a series of interactive and static touchpoints around the most important cities of the world.",

The last step has been analyzing RayBan services and introduce shoppable experiences as the one in the home-page and new services such as the comparison between models to offer a better service to customers.",
    "description_1": "The SEO strategy focused more on increasing user traffic in the eyeglasses section. After a deep SEO Audit some elements must be improved such as: the URL structure ( also titles as a consequence ); the navigation and the secondary menu arrangement. To reinforce internal linking and the user traffic there were introduced more call to actions linking to specific pages inside the most visited ones, and also some short descriptions with relevant keywords inside as a compromise between clean UI design and SEO. Based on these findings after the creation of the new tree structure the last step of the project has been producing detailed wireframes.",
